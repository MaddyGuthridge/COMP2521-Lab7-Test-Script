# Improved Lab7 Starter Code
Drop in the file `Maze.c` to get [hugely improved performance](https://youtu.be/PxdtJ3SC1Ik) when testing code. Sadly, this is incompatible with the test script below.

# Test Script `run_tests.py`
This program runs tests for COMP2521 Lab07. It may be spaghetti, but it works. Drop it into your lab folder and run it to build files and run tests.

Run `./run_tests.py -h` for help running it.

Keep in mind that this requires the files "output.txt" and "output_err.txt" to function. I don't recommend using these files for anything important.
Also note that this doesn't check that your implementation is correct. It just collects runs test files and collects output.

Disclaimer: although I've tried my best to ensure it works as well as possible, I can't guarantee it's bug-free.
I don't take any responsibility if this breaks anything (although it almost definitely won't).
