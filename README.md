# COMP2521-Lab7-Test-Script
This program runs tests for COMP2521 Lab07. It may be spaghetti, but it works. Drop it into your lab folder and run it to build files and run tests.

Run `./run_tests -h` for help running it.

Keep in mind that this requires the files "output.txt" and "output_err.txt" to function. I don't recommend using these files for anything important.
Also note that this doesn't check that your implementation is correct. It just collects runs test files and collects output.

Disclaimer: although I've tried my best to ensure it works as well as possible, I can't guarantee it's bug-free.
I don't take any responsibility if this breaks anything (although it almost definitely won't).
